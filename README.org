* Emphases possibly different from more traditional presentations:

** Unity of disciplines, "multi-physics"
Explore phenomena that involve mechanics, thermodynamics, chemistry (and EM?)

** Momentum as more general than "mv". Momentum of EM field

** Difference between universal laws and constitutive laws
Also their different roles in simulation

** Contact forces vs body forces

** Momentum, energy, etc are properties of _volumes_, not of objects
E.g. momentum of glass slab in EM field:
cannot be written in an additive way with mechanical and EM quantities

** Coordinate-dependence of work, energy, and energy budgets
(example: accelerating car)

** Equivalence of mass and energy
"conservation of mass" as a proxy for conservation of matter

** Physical time and coordinate time. Its importance in everyday technology
GPS, NASA/IAU/IERS/IUGG

** Outer-oriented vectors, bivectors?


* De-emphasis with respect to more traditional presentations:

** No time-waste with non-SI units and unit conversion

** "Kinematics" vs "dynamics": just an explanation of traditional terms
