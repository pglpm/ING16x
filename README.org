* Emphases possibly different from more traditional presentations:

- Unity of disciplines, "multi-physics". Explore phenomena that
  involve mechanics, thermodynamics, chemistry, electromagnetism.

- Momentum as more general than $\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v}$.
  Momentum of an EM field.

- Difference between universal laws and constitutive laws.
  Also their different roles in simulation.

- Contact forces vs. body forces.

- Momentum, energy, etc. are properties of *volumes* not of objects.
  For example, momentum of glass slab in EM field cannot be written in
  an additive way with mechanical and EM quantities.

- Coordinate-dependence of work, energy, and energy budgets.
  (Example: accelerating car).

- Equivalence of mass and energy. "Conservation of mass" as a proxy
  for conservation of matter.

- Physical time and coordinate time. Its importance in everyday
  technology: GPS, NASA/IAU/IERS/IUGG.

- Outer-oriented vectors. A brief intro to bivectors?

* De-emphasis with respect to more traditional presentations:
- No time-waste with non-SI units and unit conversion
  
- "Kinematics" vs "dynamics": just an explanation of traditional terms.
